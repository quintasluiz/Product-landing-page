                <h1>About</h1>
                <p id="about">The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body 
                    and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing the strings against 
                    frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of 
                    the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup 
                    and an amplifier.
                    The guitar is classified as a chordophone â€“ meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. 
                    Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of
                     the nineteenth century in the United States;[1] nylon strings came in the 1940s.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the 
                     vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the 
                     modern six-string instrument.

            <p id="products">There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar; 
                and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large 
                sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' 
                vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber.</p>

            <p id="products-one">The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked
                 individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, 
                 and country guitar playing in the United States.</p>
